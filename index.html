					  <span id = "KK">Well 2000s was just  not about 9/11 typicaly but it was the time which goave rise to 
					  many famous companies that we look up today like Tesla(2003) , Facebook(2004) ,Twitter
					  (2006)and all. Most importantly this was also the decade when Steve Jobs introduced the
					  smart touch  technology , 2007. But the reason I loved this decade till I die is cause 
					  this was the time when  most of us were born or you could say were young! Most of the 
					  iconic and game changing music albums were produced as well. Taking from Justin Timberlake,
					  Beiber , David Guetta ,  Rihana , JAY-Z ,  Maroon5 , Lady Gaga etc. have started to gain 
					  momentum right from this decade. Times were simple , no shitposting on internet in those
					  days. Songs like "I gotta feeling" and "Cry me a river" were remarkable. People used to 
					  listen to songs rather than <span style = "color:blue; font-size:20px">wasting time on  social media</span> as compared to now!
